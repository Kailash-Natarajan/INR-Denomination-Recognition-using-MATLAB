# INR-Denomination-Recognition-using-MATLAB
- Uses ORB algorithm to perform feature extraction
- Able to predict most pictures
- Not predictable as to whether a picture would be predicted properly or not
- Also model would give output regardless of whether the image contains currency note or not
- Can be improved by using neural networks
- Can be modified to detect any currency, not just INR
