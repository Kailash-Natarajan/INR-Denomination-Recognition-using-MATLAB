# INR-Denomination-Recognition-using-MATLAB
- Uses ORB algorithm to perform feature extraction
- Able to predict most pictures
- Not predictable as to whether a picture would be predicted properly or not
- Also model would give output regardless of whether the image contains currency note or not
- Can be modified to detect any currency, not just INR
- Improved version is available [here](https://github.com/Kailash-Natarajan/INR-CURRENCY-DENOMINATION-RECOGNITION-USING-TRANSFER-LEARNING). Developed using Tensorflow Keras. Leveraging the power of deep learning and transfer learning, the model has achieved 90%+ accuracy
